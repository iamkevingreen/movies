Nazi judges face justice at the hands of a military tribunal in this dramatization of the Nuremberg Judgesâ€™ trial in the aftermath of World War II. Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) heads a three-judge panel tasked with hearing the cases of four German judges who are accused of crimes against humanity. The Nazi judges contend they simply followed the law, and Haywood is forced to deal with political pressures when delivering his decision.
