In a unique combination of science fiction and legal themes, InAlienable tells the story of a researcher, Dr. Eric Norris (Richard Hatch), who gives birth to an alien being that bears his DNA. When the government seeks to take Norris’s extra-terrestrial offspring from him for experimentation, he hires a lawyer and takes the matter to court. Norris defends his right to raise “Benjamin” with creative constitutional law arguments centered on determining whether the alien is a human with the same rights as American citizens.
