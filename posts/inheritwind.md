_Inherit the Wind_ presents a fictionalized account of the 1925 Scopes “Monkey Trial,” in which a high school science teacher was fined for teaching the theory of evolution. A deeply religious prosecutor (Fredric March playing the part of  William Jennings Bryan) faces off with a bright defense attorney (Spencer Tracy playing the part of Clarence Darrow) over whether Bertram T. Cates (Dick York) violated a new Tennessee law, while reporter E.K. Hornbeck (Gene Kelly) draws national attention to the trial. The defense builds a powerful public policy argument, winning the argument though not the case as the judge finds that Cates broke the law.
