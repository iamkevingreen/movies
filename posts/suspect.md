The preposterous plot of _Suspect_ involves a defense attorney and juror teaming up to investigate who really committed the crime in a homicide trial. When a file clerk at the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., is murdered, homeless Vietnam vet Carl Wayne Anderson (Liam Neeson) is charged with the crime. Public defender Kathleen Riley (Cher) is tasked with defending Anderson, and jury member Eddie Sanger (Dennis Quaid) begins investigating the killing, turning up clues that implicate the trial judge.
