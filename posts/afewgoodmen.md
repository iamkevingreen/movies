Adopted from an Aaron Sorkin play, the plot revolves around the court martial of two junior Marines accused in the death of their comrade at Guantanamo Bay. In cracking the case, defense attorneys ( Demi Moore and Tom Cruise) put the archetypal military man Col. Nathan R. Jessep (Jack Nicholson) in the dock by exposing his mean-justifies-ends philosophy for maintaining the security for the United States. Figures like Nicholson’s character are staples of Hollywood. As the general’s adversary, Cruise portrays the talented but supercilious lawyer who achieves justice by changing his character to value idealism over expediency.
