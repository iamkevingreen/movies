_Let Him Have It_ is based on the true story of Derek Bentley, a mentally handicapped and illiterate 19-year-old boy who was convicted and executed for his role in the murder of a police officer. Bentley (Christopher Eccleston), was accompanying his friend Chris Craig (Paul Reynolds) on a burglary attempt when both were cornered by police. When a police officer attempted to capture Bentley, the prosecution argues, Bentley shouted “Let him have it, Chris!” This is offered as proof that Bentley urged Craig to shoot the officer. The defense suggests the words actually showed Bentley’s request that Craig hand his gun over to the officers.
