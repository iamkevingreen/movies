 Resurrected 1960s-era Hanna-Barbera characters populate a world in which superheroes moonlight as lawyers and Fred Flintstone is an organized crime boss. Hapless defense attorney Harvey Birdman (Gary Cole) works for Sebben & Sebben law firm, where he is mistreated by name partner Phil Ken Sebben (Stephen Colbert), constantly pestered by incompetent supervillains, and forced to endure surreal interactions with coworkers like Peter Potamus. Classic cartoon characters (Yogi Bear, Quick Draw McGraw and Augie Doggie) all make appearances as Birdmanâ€™s clients.
