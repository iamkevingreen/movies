Prosecutor Kathryn Murphy (Kelly McGillis) takes on the case of Sarah Tobias (Jodie Foster) after she is brutally gang raped by three men in a bar. The men are convicted, but Murphy is not satisfied, and she prosecutes the onlookers who cheered the men on, arguing that without them, Tobias probably would not have been raped by the other two men. The movie, based on the real-life rape of Cheryl Araujo in New Bedford, Mass., sparked a public conversation about the perception of rape and its emotional impact.
