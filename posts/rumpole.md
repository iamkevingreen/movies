Horace Rumpole (Leo McKern), an aging London-based barrister, advocates for a menagerie of clients, clinging to his role at the Old Bailey courthouse while many of his peers have moved on to more esteemed positions in the legal profession. Rumpoleâ€™s zeal for criminal defense is rivaled only by his appetite for cheap red wine and cigars. However, despite his vices, Rumpole adheres to a set of personal ethics, defending his clients with gusto and refusing to enter a guilty plea. _Rumpole of the Bailey_, originally conceived as a television play, showcases the many differences between the British and American systems of law.
