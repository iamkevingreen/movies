_Compulsion_ is based on Meyer Levin’s novel, which narrated the trial of Leopold and Loeb for a 1924 kidnapping and murder. Two wealthy University of Chicago students, Artie Strauss and Judd Steiner (Bradford Dillman and Dean Stockwell), kidnap and murder a 14-year-old boy in an attempt to commit the “perfect crime.” However, Steiner leaves his glasses at the scene, providing the prosecution with a damning piece of direct evidence. Defense attorney Jonathan Wilk (Orson Welles) attempts to save the duo from the death penalty, appealing to the jurors’ compassion with a theatrical closing argument.
