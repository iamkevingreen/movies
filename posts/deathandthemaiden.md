_Death and the Maiden_ is based on Ariel Dorfman’s play by the same name. A lawyer’s wife, Paulina Escobar (Sigourney Weaver), kidnaps a stranger who has given her husband a ride back to his house. Escobar accuses the stranger of torturing and repeatedly raping her years earlier, during the country’s fascist regime, when she was held captive. Escobar was blindfolded the entire time, which calls into question the certainty of her accusation, and the stranger, Dr. Miranda (Ben Kingsley), denies Escobar’s claims. Although her husband doubts her, Escobar finally persuades Miranda to confess to the crime.
