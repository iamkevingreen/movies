Based on Ward Greene’s _Death in the Deep South_, which itself is based on the real-life case of Leo Frank, _They Won’t Forget_ follows the story of Robert Hale (Edward Norris), a Jewish American convicted of killing student Mary Clay. Hale, her teacher from the North, is convicted and sentenced to death for her murder despite a lack of direct evidence. Although the governor commuted his death sentence, Hale is intercepted by a mob and lynched. The film works as a cautionary tale: cases built purely on circumstantial evidence can lead to problematic results.
