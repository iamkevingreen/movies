_My Cousin Vinny_ is a comedy in which an outspoken New Yorker, Vincent “Vinny” Gambini (Joe Pesci), defends his cousin (Ralph Macchio) in a murder trial. Vinny’s brash, no-nonsense attitude humorously contrasts with the prosecutor’s formal affect. Vinny’s unorthodox methods cause the judge to doubt his abilities as a lawyer, but Vinny prevails when his gearhead girlfriend (Marisa Tomei) breaks the case open.
