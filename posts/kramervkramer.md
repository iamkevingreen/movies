Based on the book by Avery Corman, Ted Kramer (Dustin Hoffman), a man devoted to his job, must manage as a single parent after his wife, Joanne (Meryl Streep), leaves him and their 7-year-old son, Billy (Justin Henry). Father and son form a close bond, but disaster strikes when Joanne returns 18 months later and demands custody of Billy. Ted struggles to find the money for a lawyer after being laid off from his high-paying job. _Kramer vs. Kramer_ examines how custody battles are handled in court and how gender stereotypes influence the process, i.e. the notion that a woman is more suited to raising a child than a man.
