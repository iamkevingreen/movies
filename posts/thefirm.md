Based on John Grisham’s novel, _The Firm_ tells the story of Mitch McDeere (Tom Cruise), an ambitious and talented law school graduate. After taking a job at Bendini, Lambert & Locke, McDeere becomes embroiled in an FBI investigation into the firm’s possible ties to the Mafia when two of the firm’s associates are murdered. McDeere uses deft legal maneuvering to escape the vice of the FBI on one side and organized crime on the other. He proves the firm’s partners are guilty of overbilling, while avoiding implicating mobsters in the scheme.
