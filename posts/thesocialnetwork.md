Based on a Ben Mezrich book describing the legal battles surrounding the creation of Facebook, _The Social Network_ is narrated as a flashback from the deposition room. Inside, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) answers questions from the legal representative of the co-founder of Facebook (Andrew Garfield) as well as the two brothers WinklevossÂ who claim Zuckerberg stole their idea for the social media site. The film recounts the sometimes-tawdry, sometimes brilliant and other times sad twists that birthed a whole new kind of media empire.
