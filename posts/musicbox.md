_Music Box_ is a parable on why lawyers should avoid taking cases when they are too personally close to their clients. Ann Talbot (Jessica Lange) defends her father, Mike “Mishka” Laszlo (Armin Mueller-Stahl), in a case regarding his possible involvement in war crimes in fascist Hungary during World War II. Although she clears him of the charges, Talbot later discovers her father was guilty of the crimes.
