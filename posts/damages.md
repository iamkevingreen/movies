Recent law school grad Ellen Parsons (Rose Byrne) passes on a lucrative offer from a big law firm in New York to accept a position with the boutique Hewes & Associates. Under the tutelage of the cold and calculating Patty Hewes (Glenn Close), Ellen begins to realize that the life of a lawyer can take its toll on personal relationships. Parsons and Hewes make a dysfunctional-but-effective team as they represent a group of disgruntled ex-employees who were fleeced out of retirement benefits by billionaire Arthur Frobisher (Ted Danson), while Frobisher’s lawyer, Ray Fiske (Željko Ivanek) handles the legal dirty work.
