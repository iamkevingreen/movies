Clinton Judd (Carl Betz), Houston defense attorney, takes on high-profile cases, aided by his assistant Ben Caldwell (Stephen Young). Eschewing the formulaic approach of some earlier legal dramas, _Judd, for the Defense_ tackles controversial topics that were controversial for its time, ranging from draft dodging to heart transplants. Judd drew comparisons to some well-known real-life lawyers. One of whom, Percy Foreman, saw such similarities between himself and Judd that he threatened the showâ€™s producers with a lawsuit.
