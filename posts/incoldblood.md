Based on Truman Capote’s true-crime book, _In Cold Blood_ tells the story of two would-be burglars (Robert Blake and Scott Wilson) who see their plan unravel. The botched robbery results in the bloody murder of an entire family. The two head across the Mexican border and temporarily elude the police investigation, but a trip to Las Vegas ends in their capture. The evidence against the killers stacks up, and they eventually confess to their crimes, each hoping to receive the more lenient sentence. At trial, the prosecution argues for first-degree murder convictions, based on the killers’ apparent premeditation.
