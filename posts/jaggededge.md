Jagged Edge tells the story of a lawyer who allows her feelings for her client to cloud her judgment in defending him. After Paige Forrester, a San Francisco socialite, is found dead in her home, her husband (Jeff Bridges) is arrested for the murder. He seeks help from Teddy Barnes (Glenn Close), who falls for him during the trial. The resulting romance blinds Barnes to Jackâ€™s guilt, a mistake that puts her own life in danger when she realizes the truth.
