A materialistic lawyer, driven by cutthroat ambition, slowly realizes his need to rethink his life and ideals when he begins suffering from hallucinations. When Eli Stone (Jonny Lee Miller) hears George Michael’s “Faith” while meeting with opposing counsel, he begins to consider the possibility of the existence of a higher power. As the hallucinations become more vivid, Stone realizes there’s more to being a lawyer than making money. He starts taking pro bono cases, representing clients in need, and trying to use his talent to make a positive impact on the world.
