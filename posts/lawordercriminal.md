NYPD Detectives Robert Goren (Vincent D’Onofrio) and Alexandra Eames (Kathryn Erbe) frequently clash with Assistant District Attorney Ron Carver (Courtney B. Vance), who takes issue with the cops’ loose-cannon approach to criminal investigations. A recurring theme is the conflict between the detectives’ gut instincts and the prosecutor’s need to build a case that will hold up in court. However, the many moving parts of the law enforcement system often cohere with sufficient efficiency to ensure the bad guys go to prison by the end of the episode.
