Based on the John Grisham novel, _The Client_ begins in Tennessee when 11-year-old Mark Sway (Brad Renfro) witnesses the suicide of attorney Jerome Clifford (Walter Olkewicz). Before Clifford kills himself, he gives Mark dangerous information concerning the Mob. Mark realizes that the information may bring harm to him and his family, so he hires lawyer Regina Love (Susan Sarandon) without giving her the whole story. However, they must beware of defense attorney Roy Foltrigg (Tommy Lee Jones) who is trying to solve the case in an effort to boost his career. The film depicts lawyers using blackmail and “bending” legal rules to gain advantage.
