It’s the movie that defined law schools for a generation: the Socratic drill-sergeant professor (John Houseman) browbeating the over-achieving, stressed-out students at that symbol of excellence: Harvard Law. From the novel by John Jay Osborn Jr., first-year student James Hart (Timothy Bottoms) is obsessed with impressing his demanding professor, Charles W. Kingsfield Jr., and he falls into an affair with the law professor’s daughter (Lindsay Wagner). Meanwhile, Hart’s study group battles the workload and each other as they steadily crack under the pressure. The Paper Chase tells us that the point of law school is teaching students how to think like lawyers though it may drive them loony in the process.
