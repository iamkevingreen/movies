Romantic and ethical conflicts of interest are more plentiful than legal briefs in this 1980s star vehicle. An Assistant district Attorney Tom Logan (Robert Redford) becomes involved in a high-profile art case in which Chelsea Deardon (Daryl Hannah) is accused of stealing a painting from an art dealer. Deardon claims the painting was made for her by her father and enlists the help of attorney Laura Kelly (Debra Winger). Kelly, in turn, convinces Logan to help with the case despite the damage it could do to his campaign for district attorney.
