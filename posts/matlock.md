Ben Matlock (Andy Griffith) is a criminal defense attorney with his own law practice in Atlanta. He is usually accompanied throughout the episodes by an employee Tyler Hudson (Kene Holliday) and young lawyer Michelle Thomas (Nancy Stafford). Typical are Matlockâ€™s dramatic courtroom scenes, exposing the culprit in front of a jury. Typically, the viewer would not only see the attorney prevail in court, but also watch him investigate, collect evidence, conduct interviews, and solve the case beforehand.
