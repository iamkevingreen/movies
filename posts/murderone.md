Hoffman & Associates (later Wyler & Associates) represent high-profile criminal clients, tackling just four cases over the course of the show’s two-season run. The first seasons covers a single, convoluted case in great depth, with the truth becoming increasingly apparent to viewers as evidence emerges. In the case of a murdered 15-year-old Hollywood call girl, Theodore Hoffman (Daniel Benzali) takes an unconventional route and represents two of the suspects. _Murder One_ also deals with many aspects of criminal procedure, ranging from motions to dismiss to “fruit of the poisonous tree” probable cause arguments.
