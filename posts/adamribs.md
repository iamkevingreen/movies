 In this lighthearted legal comedy, a husband-and-wife-legal team (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn) is forced to represent opposing sides in a trial in which a woman is accused of intentionally killing her husband after she accidentally shoots him when she finds him in bed with another woman. The trial becomes an all-out battle of the sexes as the lawyers present their cases. Amanda Bonner (Hepburn) calls to the stand various women who are successful in their fields as evidence that women are equal to men and therefore should receive the same treatment in court. Amanda then asks the judges to review her client’s case as they would a man’s.
