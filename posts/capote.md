Based on the biography by Gerald Clarke, _Capote_ follows Truman Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as he researches and writes his most famous work, _In Cold Blood_. This film gives insight not only into Capoteâ€™s life and personality, but also into the murder case that inspired his book. It shows how Capote uses money to bend the law in to his ends. Capote needs more information out of the killers, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins, Jr.) and Richard Hickock (Mark Pellegrino) so he uses his influence to postpone their execution.
