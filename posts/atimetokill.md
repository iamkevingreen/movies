Based on a John Grisham’s novel, when two white men rape a 10-year-old black girl in rural Mississippi, the girl’s father (Samuel L. Jackson) seeks the legal advice of Jake Brigance (Matthew McConaughey). Brigance admits the rapists may walk free, so Carl Lee Hailey (Jackson) gets a rifle and kills the two men outside the courthouse. The second half of the movie follows the quest for justice in court. Brigance and law student Ellen Roark (Sandra Bullock) defend Hailey in a milieu riled up by the trial in this imagined slice of the post-Jim Crow South.
