Taking the granddaddy of all conspiracy theories as its theme, _JFK_ is a political thriller that focuses on the shooting of President John F. Kennedy. District Attorney Jim Garrison (Costner) accuses the U.S. government of orchestrating the Kennedy assassination. He claims Lee Harvey Oswald (Oldman) was framed. The culprit he attempts to expose in court, other than the U.S. government, is Clay Shaw (Tommy Lee Jones), a Louisiana businessman. The film displays courtroom procedure, including how that procedure is broken in favor of the “cover up.” It also depicts how lawyers investigate their cases, although Garrison and his team do not always investigate in a conventional or legal manner.
