This film is based on the true story of Lindy Chamberlain (Meryl Streep), whose daughter was taken by a dingo while she and her husband were camping in Australia. The body was never found and Chamberlain is charged with murder. Public opinion turns against Chamberlain during her trial, and, though she steadfastly maintains her story, she is sent to prison for the crime. Three years later, Chamberlain’s daughter’s jacket is discovered with dingo saliva on it, which results in Chamberlain’s exoneration.
