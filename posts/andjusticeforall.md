Corruption of the criminal justice system during the 1970s is the theme as defense attorney Arthur Kirkland (Al Pacino) represents Judge Henry Fleming (John Forsythe) in a rape trial only because Fleming blackmails him. Meanwhile, Kirkland is surrounded by colleagues drawn to madness by the pressures of an overloaded and seemingly amoral system. The film contributes the classic lines barked at the judge in court as the main character has finally had enough: “You’re out of order! You’re out of order! The whole trial is out of order!”
