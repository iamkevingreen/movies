_Young Mr. Lincoln_ is a fictionalized account of President Abe Lincolnâ€™s early life as a lawyer and how he handles the biggest case of his young career. When two brothers are accused of stabbing a local man after getting into a squabble, the only witness is their mother, who refuses to name the son who committed the crime. Lincoln (Henry Fonda) proves the innocence of both men when he catches a local man lying on the witness stand. Later courtroom dramas would follow a similar template by solving cases in dramatic fashion during cross examination.
