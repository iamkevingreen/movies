Exploring the role of the jury in an American criminal trial and shot almost entirely in a jury room, 12 Angry Men – originally a play by Reginald Rose – tells the story of twelve jurors as they deliberate on the fate of an 18-year-old accused of murder. At first, Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) is the only one unwilling to convict the defendant, meaning the jurors must continue their deliberations until they can reach a unanimous verdict. The others begin to change their minds as they consider the evidence and struggle with the concept of making the decision based on reasonable doubt rather than personal bias.
