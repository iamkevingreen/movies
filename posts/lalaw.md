The lawyers of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak deal with legal issues ranging from tort litigation and criminal defense to professional ethics, with storylines often covering topical material like the Los Angeles riots. Douglas Brackman, Jr. (Alan Rachins) espouses the stereotype of the money-hungry lawyer as he reprimands his associates for taking pro bono cases. Arnie Becker (Corbin Bernsen), as a hot-shot divorce lawyer, treats his position as an opportunity to meet newly available women, while Michael Kuzak (Harry Hamlin) struggles with the moral and ethical implications of representing clients who are likely guilty.
