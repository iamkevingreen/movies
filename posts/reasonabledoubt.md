Exploring the sometimes-strained relationship between police officers and prosecutors, _Reasonable Doubts_ tells the story of Assistant District Attorney Tess Kaufman (Marlee Matlin) and Detective Dicky Cobb (Mark Harmon). Kaufman and Cobb butt heads over the rights of the accused, with Kaufman tending to be more sympathetic to the idea of “innocent until proven guilty.” Because Kaufman is deaf and Cobb can read sign language, the two form a strong bond over the course of their working relationship.
