Based on the 1841 Supreme Court case _United States v. The Amistad_, Attorney Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) defends a group of captive Africans who were taken from Sierra Leone, sold into slavery, rebelled on the slave ship Amistad, and were later captured along the U.S. coast. Baldwin eventually wins the case on the strength of his argument that because his clients are from Africa and the international slave trade is banned, they are not technically slaves. In the Supreme Court, anti-slavery figure John Adams (Anthony Hopkins) argued that the slaves fought for their freedom, much like American Revolutionaries did.
