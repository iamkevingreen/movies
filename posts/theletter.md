_The Letter_ focuses on a lawyer who is confronted with a conflict between professional ethics and fiduciary duty. He must decide whether to destroy incriminating evidence against his client. Leslie Crosbie (Bette Davis) shoots and kills Geoff Hammond, an acquaintance she claims tried to rape her. During the trial, Hammond’s widow (Gale Sondergaard) finds a letter from Crosbie to Hammond detailing how they were having an affair. Crosbie’s lawyer, Howard Joyce (James Stephenson), buys the letter from the widow using Crosbie’s husband’s money, freeing her. However, the movie ends on a dark note when Mrs. Hammond takes justice into her own hands.
