As the ones defending the “villains,” courtroom dramas often present defense lawyers as untrustworthy, unlikeable characters. _The Lincoln Lawyer_ is told from the perspective of Mickey Haller (Matthew McConaughey), a criminal defense attorney working in L.A. The film turns on the struggle of a defense attorney to stand up for the principles of the rule of law in the face of threats to friends and family by a murderer (Ryan Phillippe), whom Haller has been conned into defending. The lawyer must adhere to the attorney-client privilege while exposing the killer, and free an innocent man from jail.
