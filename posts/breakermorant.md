A trio of Australian soldiers are court martialed by the British army for shooting prisoners and a noncombatant. Based on a real 1902 case during the Boer Wars in South Africa, the movie turns on the notion that the colonial masters have adopted a take-no-prisoners policy for Boer irregulars. The court martial proceedings are transformed into a sham as the title character (Edward Woodward), a poet-warrior, and his comrades are sacrificed for _raisons d’etat_. The movie explores the moral dilemma of fighting a guerilla conflict while trying to abide by the customary laws of war and the colonial system’s unfair treatment of Australians by the ruling English.
