Attorney Owen Marshall (Arthur Hill) puts his heart and soul into defending legal underdogs who deserve his expertise at trial. Against the backdrop of sunny California, the Santa Barbara-based lawyer represents a diverse cast of clients ranging from hippies accused of murder to millionaires accused of paternity. The common thread among them all is Marshall’s zealous belief in his clients’ innocence, regardless of whether the cases are criminal or civil matters.
