 A wealthy London widow dies and her younger male friend Leonard Vole (Tyrone Power) draws suspicion when he is found to be the beneficiary of her recently altered will. In the Agatha Christie story, Vole is the client of wily barrister Sir Wilfrid Robarts (Charles Laughton). In the courtroom, Vole’s wife Christine (Marlene Dietrich) testifies against her husband – first showing that her marriage to Leonard was a sham, then divulging that he confessed to the murder. However, a mystery woman provides Robarts with letters showing Christine’s motive for lying in court, a twist that results in Leonard walking free – temporarily.
