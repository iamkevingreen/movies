Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), an unemployed single mother, takes a job as a legal assistant and stumbles upon a potentially massive class action lawsuit. As she investigates, Brockovich realizes energy corporation Pacific Gas and Electric has been quietly covering the medical expenses of the Hinkley, Calif., residents who were exposed to the townâ€™s tainted groundwater. Perseverance and sex appeal pay off for Brockovich when she clinches a big settlement between residents and the company.
