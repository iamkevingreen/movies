This film is based on the true story of a _60 Minutes_ segment that aired in November 1995 about Jeffrey Wigand’s testimony against corporate tobacco companies. After being fired from his job at the firm Brown & Williamson, lawyer Wigand (Russell Crowe) is tricked into signing a confidentiality agreement that is supposed to prevent him from commenting on, or interpreting, the papers brought to him by a client describing the addictive nature of tobacco and the tobacco company’s attempt to hide it. _60 Minutes_ producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) fights to broadcast an interview in which Wigand tells his story.
