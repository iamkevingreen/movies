Spun off from the 1973 film, which was itself based on a novel released in 1970, _The Paper Chase_ follows first-year Harvard Law student James T. Hart (James Stephens) as he navigates the dangerous waters of an Ivy League legal education. Hart ostensibly had his sights set on Harvard because of its renowned contracts professor, Charles Kingsfield (John Houseman). Hart and his fellow 1Ls soon realize that an effective legal education is often fraught with drama and adversity, from high-pressure courses to competitive classmates.
