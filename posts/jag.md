Commander Harmon “Harm” Rabb, Jr. (David James Elliott) and Lieutenant Colonel Sarah “Mac” MacKenzie (Catherine Bell) are military lawyers, known as judge advocates, who litigate cases against Navy and Marine personnel. The two serve as both investigators and attorneys, frequently going on adventures to determine the facts of the cases they later try in military court. The onscreen romantic sparks between the two partners drive the dramatic plotlines, while viewers get a chance to see the proceedings of American military courts-martial.
