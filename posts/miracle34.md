In a fanciful Christmas tale, a young lawyer (John Payne) defends an elderly man (Edmund Gwenn) before the New York Supreme Court. The man, who claims to be Santa Claus, was deemed insane and institutionalized, despite the good publicity he was bringing his employer, the Macy’s flagship department store. The case against the man is based primarily on the “expert” testimony of a psychiatrist (Porter Hall), due to the lack of other evidence available. The young lawyer wins the case when he brings the U.S. government in on his side. Letters addressed to the old man as “Santa Claus” are introduced as evidence because the post office is delivering them to him.
