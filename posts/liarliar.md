A comedy playing on the stereotype of the slippery lawyer, _Liar Liar_ casts Jim Carey as Fletcher Reede, a successful attorney who is a compulsive liar. Reede’s son (Justin Cooper) makes a wish and Reede finds he is unable to tell a lie for 24 hours. It’s an affliction that hurts his practice and his home life. But Reede begins to realize that a truthful life can benefit both his big case as well as his relationship with his son.
