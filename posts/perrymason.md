_Perry Mason_, inspired by a series of books by Erle Stanley Gardner, follows the titular defense attorney (Raymond Burr) as he establishes his clientsâ€™ innocence time after time. The Los Angeles lawyer is aided in his pursuit of justice by his private investigator, Paul Drake (William Hopper) and his secretary, Della Street (Barbara Hale). Perhaps not the most accurate portrayal of courtroom procedure, Perry Mason set the bar for future legal dramas with its dramatic interpretations of strategic direct and cross examination techniques.
