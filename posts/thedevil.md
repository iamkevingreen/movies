The premise of _The Devil’s Advocate_ is that demons are well suited as lawyers. Based on Andrew Neiderman’s novel of the same name, the film tells the story of young, talented Kevin Lomax (Keanu Reeves), of Gainesville, Fla., who takes a job at a prestigious law firm in New York City. The movie chronicles Lomax’s moral demise as he wins cases on behalf villainous clients but ignores his wife’s (Charlize Theron) slow spiral into insanity. John Milton (Al Pacino), the charismatic but dark figure who lures Lomax to New York, is none other than Satan himself.
