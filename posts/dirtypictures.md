Based on the 1990 trial of Cincinnati Contemporary Arts Center Director Dennis Barrie (James Woods), _Dirty Pictures_ depicts Barrieâ€™s trial on obscenity charges after he displayed pornographic photos taken by Robert Mapplethorpe. Barrie, asserting his First Amendment rights, is eventually found not guilty, but the public backlash against the photos has repercussions for Barrie and art museums around the country.
