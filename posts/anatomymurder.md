A man’s state of mind at the exact moment of a murder is debated at trial, with the accused, Army Lt. Frederick Manion (Ben Gazzara), claiming he was insane when he shot and killed a local innkeeper who he believed to have raped his wife. Manion is found not guilty when his “humble country lawyer” (James Stewart) presents evidence of Manion’s wife’s torn panties. The film tackles the taboo topic of rape and delves into the concept of “temporary insanity” as a defense for murder.
