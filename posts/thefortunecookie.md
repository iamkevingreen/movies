A professional cameraman, Harry Hinkle, (Jack Lemmon) gets hurt when a football player collides with him at a Browns game. Though Hinkle’s injuries are minor, his scheming brother-in-law lawyer William H. “Whiplash Willie” Gingrich (Walter Matthau) concocts a plan to defraud the insurance company by pretending Hinkle’s leg has been partially paralyzed. The insurance company, suspecting trickery, employs an investigator (Cliff Osmond) to sniff out the truth. The film explores the ethics of the legal profession with a critical depiction of “ambulance chasers.”
