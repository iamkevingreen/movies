Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews) conspires with his future father-in-law, publisher Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer), to frame himself in the murder of a stripper, Patty Gray, in the hopes of showing the inadequacy of circumstantial evidence. The two plan to have Spencer reveal the phony evidence after Garrett’s conviction, illustrating the district attorney’s ineptitude. The plan goes awry when Spencer dies in a car crash, leaving Garrett on the hook for the crime.
