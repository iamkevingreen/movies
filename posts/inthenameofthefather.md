A cautionary tale of police powers and the public’s desire to find someone to blame for a heinous crime, the movie relates true events that put the Guilford Four in prison for years. It recounts Gerry Conlon’s autobiography, _Proved Innocent: The Story of Gerry Conlon of the Guildford Four_. The group is falsely charged with a pub bombing committed by the IRA. They are convicted after being tortured and intimidated into confessions by British authorities. The film follows the life of Gerry (Daniel Day Lewis) and his father Giuseppe Conlon (Pete Postlethwaite) as they attempt to survive in prison and finally cooperate with their lawyer (Emma Thompson) to overturn a perversion of justice.
