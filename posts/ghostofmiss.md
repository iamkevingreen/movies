This film is based on the true story of the 1994 trial of Byron De La Beckwith (James Woods). After civil rights leader Medger Evers is murdered in 1963, De La Beckwith is tried twice for the crime, with each trial resulting in a hung jury. A quarter century later, District Attorney Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin) and Evansâ€™s widow (Whoopi Goldberg) bring the killer, Beckwith, to justice. To do it, they must battle an evidentiary trail grown cold with time and racism still warm in a state of the old Confederacy.
