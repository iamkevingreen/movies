Down-on-his-luck lawyer Frank Galvin (Paul Newman) takes a medical malpractice case thatâ€™s expected to result in a slam-dunk settlement for his client. However, hoping to redeem his disappointing career, Frank decides to try the case and turns down the offer. Battling his own heavy drinking and a series of courtroom reverses, the decision to go to trial appears to be a colossal miscalculation. But Galvin finds a single witness whose testimony swings the case in his favor.
