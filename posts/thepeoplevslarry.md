This film chronicles the true story of porn-king Larry Flynt (Woody Harrelson). Flynt publishes a lewd cartoon in his magazine Hustler insinuating that religious leader Jerry Falwell (Richard Paul) committed incest with his mother. Falwell sues Flynt and _Hustler_ for libel. Falwell wins the case, but Flynt, aided by attorney Alan Isaacman (Edward Norton), successfully argues in the U.S. Supreme Court that people would have the common sense to understand that the lewd commentary was satirical. Flyntâ€™s distasteful business and bombast underscore the point that the First Amendment was designed first of all to protect unpopular speech.
