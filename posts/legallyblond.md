For the current generation of law students, _Legally Blonde_ has become the default Hollywood portrayal of law schools. In the comedy, Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon) pursues a degree at Harvard law defying all odds against her. Initially portrayed as a ditsy sorority girl, Woods seems incapable of earning a degree. Her decision to go to law school is initially fueled by her desire to win back the affection of her ex-boyfriend, but she finally decides to pursue law for her own empowerment.
