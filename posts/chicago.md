The courts, murder and the press coalesce in this jazz-era mashup based on real Chicago cases in the 1920s. Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is accused of double murder, soon joined in the lockup by Roxie Hart (Renée Zellweger), while Billy Flynn (Gere) is the silver-tonged attorney for both. By creating public images as part fact and lots of fiction, Flynn generates sympathy for the women among their jurors. The audience on the other side of the screen knows the women are guilty as charged, but the movie suggests skillful public relations can substitute the public’s passions and prejudices for the rule of law.
