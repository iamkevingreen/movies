Brigadier General William Mitchell (Gary Cooper) is demoted to colonel after disobeying his superior officers by showing that his aircraft could sink a battleship. It was Mitchellâ€™s attempt to demonstrate the importance of air power. When his friend is killed in the crash of dirigible, the USS Shenandoah, Mitchell publically criticizes the U.S. Army and Navy for underfunding the air service and he is court-martialed. Mitchell is found guilty of the charges against him, but he wins over the public and succeeds in bringing change to the Air Force.
