Boston-born Tony Petrocelli (Barry Newman) takes his Harvard legal education to the American Southwest, setting up his practice in the fictional town of San Remo. There, Petrocelli and wife Maggie (Susan Howard) live in a trailer, while Petrocelli employs a local cowboy (Albert Salmi) to investigate his clients’ stories. With each passing case, Petrocelli finds a key piece of evidence that turns the trial in his client’s favor, weakening the prosecution’s case and convincing viewers through liberal use of flashback sequences.
