Sir Thomas More (Paul Scofield), Lord Chancellor of England, refuses to ask the Pope to annul King Henry VIIIâ€™s marriage, believing such an action to be contrary to his faith. Despite mounting pressures to aid the King in ending his marriage, More chooses instead to resign from his position as Chancellor. More uses his knowledge of English Law to defend his position, and the film culminates in a dramatic courtroom scene in which the tragic hero is sentenced to death for treason.
