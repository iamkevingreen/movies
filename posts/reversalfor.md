Reversal of Fortune was adapted from law professor Alan Dershowitz’s “Reversal of Fortune: Inside the von Bülow Case,” a book based on the true story of socialite Sunny von Bülow’s unexplained coma and the murder trial that followed. The film concentrates not on the trial, but on the preparation beforehand by law professor Alan Dershowitz (Ron Silver), who is unconvinced of his client Claus von Bülow’s (Jeremy Irons) innocence.
