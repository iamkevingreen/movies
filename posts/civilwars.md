True to its title, _Civil Wars_ deals with the often-nasty business of divorce lawyering. Sydney Guilford (Mariel Hemingway), Charlie Howell (Peter Onorati) and Eli Levinson (Alan Rosenberg) play New York attorneys tasked with helping their clients come out on the winning end of bitter civil disputes. Though the show proved short-lived, two of the characters continued to exist on _L.A. Law_.
