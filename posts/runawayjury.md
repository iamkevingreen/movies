From a John Grisham novel, _Runaway Jury_ pits a conniving juror against a conniving jury consultant. Celeste Wood (Joanna Going) sues the gun company that manufactured the weapon used in a mass murder that killed her husband. Nick Easter (John Cusack) manipulates his way onto the jury, manipulates fellow jurors and finally manipulates the lawyers. We never know where heâ€™s going to land until Easter double-crosses his final mark.
