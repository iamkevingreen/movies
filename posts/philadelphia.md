The courtroom drama depicts a gay man (Tom Hanks) suffering from AIDS fighting for both his life and his career. _Philadelphia_ uses elements from the life of Geoffrey Bowers, who was fired in 1986 from Baker & McKenzie in Chicago. Fired for his illness, Andrew Beckett (Hanks) seeks the counsel of Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), a lawyer experienced in personal injury law. Miller is revealed as a homophobe who clings to harmful stereotypes about AIDS. But he agrees to represent Beckett. Miller’s change of heart as the story progresses effectively draws in the audience in an early example of AIDS-related issues portrayed on film.
