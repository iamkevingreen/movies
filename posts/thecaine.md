Set in World War II’s Pacific theatre, this film is based on Herman Wouk’s eponymous Pulitzer-prize-winning novel. A naval officer, Ensign Willis Seward Keith (Robert Francis), is court martialed when he wrests command of a ship from Phillip Queeg (Humphrey Bogart), who Keffer believes is insane and unfit to captain the vessel. The ship’s executive officer, Lieutenant Stephen Maryk, is implicated as well. Attorney Lieutenant Barney Greenwald (José Ferrer) represents the two. Greenwald proves Queeg’s insanity with masterful use of cross-examination, causing Queeg to break down in court.
