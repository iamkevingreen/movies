This film adaptation of Harper Leeâ€™s novel focuses on the issue of racial prejudice in the Depression-era south where a black man, Tom Robinson (Brock Peters), is wrongly accused of raping a young white woman. A white lawyer, Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck), endangers himself and his family while defending Robinson. Finch approaches the monumental task of exonerating Robinson in front of an all-white jury, which draws the ire of the prejudiced locals.
