In this film, Rozat “Rusty” Sabich (Harrison Ford) is charged with the murder of his colleague, prosecutor Carolyn Polhemus (Greta Scacchi), with whom he had been romantically involved. District Attorney Raymond Horgan (Brian Dennehy), who also had been involved with Polhemus, assigns Sabich to the case. Meanwhile, the evidence implicating Sabich himself in the crime begins to stack up, eventually resulting in his arrest on charges of murder.
