Amy Gray (Amy Brenneman) balances family law with family life as a lawyer-turned-judge. As a recently divorced single mother, Amy’s daily struggles with raising her children and finding a new relationship are often mirrored by the cases she sees in Connecticut family court. Adding to the drama, Gray’s mother (Tyne Daly) is a social worker whose opinionated nature and strong-willed personality tend to conflict with Gray’s decisions. Gray builds a reputation as a strict but fair judge who believes in the legal system’s power to save the lives of troubled teenagers.
