A father and daughter (Gene Hackman and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) go head-to-head in a trial pitting American consumers against powerful corporations. Jed Ward (Hackman) is the head of a firm dedicated to revealing the injustices committed by corporate America, while his daughter is close to becoming partner at a firm that defends the same corporations. They come to legal blows in the case of a class action lawsuit filed against an auto manufacturer that built unreasonably dangerous cars.
