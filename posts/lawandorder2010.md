As the longest running crime drama on American primetime television, _Law & Order_ dealt with a wide range of court cases, including several based on real life events. Most episodes focus on a police investigation in the first half, and a trial in the second. The show was created in an attempt to add realism to the police procedural drama genre, with the protagonists not always ending up victorious.
