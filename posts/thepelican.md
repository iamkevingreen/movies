In a classic conspiracy theory thriller from a John Grisham novel, Tulane University Law School student Darby Shaw (Julia Roberts) sparks an FBI investigation after writing a legal brief seeking the culprits in the assassination of two Supreme Court justices. She theorizes who would profit from their deaths based on their holdings and concludes that it is a wealthy businessman whose case is headed for the high court. Many explosions and chases later, investigate reporter Gray Grantham (Denzel Washington) helps solve and expose the malefactors in business and government.
