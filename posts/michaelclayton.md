Michael Clayton (George Clooney) is a law firm “fixer” who has lost his vast earnings to gambling and found himself the target of a corporate murder-for-hire scheme. Clayton locks horns with Karen Crowder (Tilda Swinton), using his skills as a lawyer to expose the general counsel for the U-North corporation, which is engaged in a class action law firm against the clients of Clayton’s firm.
