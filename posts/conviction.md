Echoing the ongoing innocence projects and stream of exonerations around the country, _Conviction_ is based on the real-life story of Betty Anne Walters (Hilary Swank) and her brother Kenny Walters (Sam Rockwell). Kenny was wrongly accused and convicted of murder in 1983. Betty Anne goes to law school and does everything in her power to help get him out of prison. After a decade on the case, she brings to bear new technology – DNA evidence – and the testimony of original witnesses, who admits to perjury, to clear Kenny.
