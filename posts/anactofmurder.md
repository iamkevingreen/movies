Judge Calvin Cooke (Fredric March) intentionally kills his wife (Florence Eldridge), who is afflicted with terminal brain cancer, in an effort to relieve her of her pain. He plans to plead guilty to his crime and be convicted, but defense attorney David Douglas (Edmond O’Brien) takes Cooke’s case. Cooke is acquitted when Douglas proves that Cooke’s wife was already dead due to an overdose from her medication and that she knew previously she was going to die. Cooke’s understanding of _mens rea_ (a defendant’s state of mind) is forever changed.
