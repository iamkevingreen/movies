_Boston Legal_ spun off from The Practice, with several characters making the jump to the new show. Alan Shore (James Spader), a young attorney, begins his work at a civil firm, Crane, Poole & Schmidt, where he is mentored by eccentric veteran attorney Denny Crane (William Shatner). Shore takes on a challenging caseload, winning his cases with methods that occasionally verge on the unethical.
