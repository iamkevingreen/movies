A Civil Action is based on Jonathan Harr’s book, which tells the story of _Anderson v. Cryovac._ Groundwater contaminated by chemical dumping causes the deaths of several children in a small Massachusetts town and the parents seek to file a case against the responsible companies. Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta) takes on the case in an attempt to reap a windfall, but the opposite occurs. As the case takes over Schlichtmann’s life, his firm falls deeply into debt.
