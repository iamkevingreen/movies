_Counselor at Law_ examines the life of a young lawyer raised on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. George Simon (John Barrymore) is a workaholic with a lot on his plate. On top of his caseload, Simon has to deal with a rival lawyer threatening to ruin his reputation and an unfaithful wife. As he tumbles into the depths of despair, he considers suicide as an escape from the pressure – a dark depiction of the stressful nature of the legal profession.
