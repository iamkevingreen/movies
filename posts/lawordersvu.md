The popularity of _Law & Order_ caused NBC to create several spinoffs, with _SVU_ arguably eclipsing the original in popularity. Many episodes of this procedural crime drama are based on real cases. It distinguishes itself from the original show by delving into cases of sexual assault, the characters being in the Special Victims Unit of a fictional New York police agency. _A Law & Order: SVU_ episode takes the viewer through a police investigation, and then a court trial showing lawyers and police officers handling the nuances of a sexual assault case.
